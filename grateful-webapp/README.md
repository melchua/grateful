## Grateful Webapp

### Summary

This is the frontend portion for our webapp. Currently just this readme file to detail out the technologies we're planning on using.

### Tech

- NextJs/ReactJs
- Hooks, Context, Typescript
- css-modules
- Axios
- Husky
- Auth0 for login

### Running for Development

1. Setup your environment variables:

`cp .env.example .env.development.local`
Fill out the necessary credentials

2. Start the client (make sure you've already started the server)
   `yarn dev` to start the client

We're going to use port 7000 for the client
And we're gonna use port 7080 for the node server

### Build and Deploy

TBD
